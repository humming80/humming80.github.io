## Welcome to Yuanyuan Tian's Home Page

Yuanyuan is currently a Principal Scientist at Microsoft Gray Systems Lab and an ACM Distinguished Member. Before Microsoft, she was a Principal Research Staff Member at IBM Almaden Research Center. She received her PhD degree in Computer Science & Engineering in 2008 and MS degree in Computer Science & Engineering in 2005 both from University of Michigan, and BS degree in Computer Science & Technology with honor in 2003 from Peking University.

### Reseach Areas

**SQL for Big Data**: Yuanyuan's work in this area includes SQL-on-Hadoop, Hybrid Warehouse (integration between Hadoop and Enterprise Data Warehouses), and HTAP (Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing) for Big Data. She collaborated closely with the IBM software group. Her work on SQL-on-Hadoop was tied to the IBM Db2 Big SQL product, and the Wildfire HTAP system she has co-developed has been released as the [IBM Db2 Event Store](https://www.ibm.com/products/db2-event-store) product.

_Selected Papers_: HTAP for Big Data (VLDB'20, BigData'19, SIGMOD'19, EDBT'19, CIDR'17, SIGMOD'16 Demo), Hybrid Warehouses (TODS'16, EDBT'15), CoHadoop (PVLDB'11), Hadoop Joins (SIGMOD'10)

**Graph Analytics**: Yuanyuan has long standing interests in graph analytics. She has written two books on large scale graph processing. Her current research includes building distributed graph-processing systems, designing distributed graph algorithms, and social network analysis. Her PhD thesis was on querying graph databases. She was the founder and technical lead of a project on supporting graph analytics inside relational databases, which is released as [IBM Db2 Graph](https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/icpdata/docs/content/SSQNUZ_latest/svc-db2w/db2w-graph-ovu.html).

**System Support for Machine Learning**: Yuanyuan is the co-inventor and a lead developer for a large-scale machine learning system, called SystemML. It is now a top-level [Apache open source project](http://systemds.apache.org/). Recently, she has worked on integrating big SQL and big ML systems, and designing novel distributed time-biased sampling algorithms for online ML model management.

_Selected Papers_: Time-biased Sampling for Online Model Mangement (TODS'19, SIGMOD Record'19, EDBT'18), Integration of SQL and ML (EDBT'15), SystemML on YARN (SIGMOD'15), SystemML Optimizer (IEEE DE Bulletin'14), ParFor in SystemML (PVLDB'14), Numerical Stability in SystemML (ICDE'12), SystemML Archtecture (ICDE'11).
