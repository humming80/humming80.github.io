Yuanyuan is an amateur artist. Ever since she could remember things, she is always fond of drawing and painting. As a teenager, she even won some awards in local and national art competitions in China. Although Yuanyuan is now a full-time computer scientist, she still enjoys picking up her pencils and brushes whenever she has time.
